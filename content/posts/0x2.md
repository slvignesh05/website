## HTMLi (Hyper Text Markup Language Injection)

HTML is what you see in the webpages.

The Big texts in a website,background color,images and many more are all done with the possibility of HTML.

Thats why its called Frontend.

## A Live example:

1. Go to [https://htmledit.squarefree.com/](https://htmledit.squarefree.com/) {HTML live editor webiste)
2. Enter a html code such as "<h1>HTML</h1>",In the editor and you will get the output.
3. Try including a image with "<img>" tag
4.
   ```
   <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/slvignesh05/akino/1bc52c3d14a8a1fb04c48db700e1f3ab5b15688f/cat0nkolam.png" width=500>
   ```
   in the above code "src" means "Source" {where the file is retrieved from} and "width"=500 to adjust the size of the image

5.The fun part , Try injecting a XSS/HTML payload in the editor 
   ```
<img src=0 onerror=alert("xss")>
```

You will observe a alert box popup!.

Wondering why? - This happends due to the void supply of src {source link}.

We did not give a source link to the img tag and said the img tag to raise a alert() box on "onerror".

So the img tag will definitely raise a 
Basic HTML syntax involves 

```
<h1>title</h1> "<h1>title</h1>" - Title tag

<p>paragraph tag</p> "<p>paragraph tag</p>"
```
## So what happens in HTMLi
